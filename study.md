## Array#push vs. Array.prototype.push()

What are the similarities and differences between Ruby's and JavaScript's `push`
Array methods?

Similarities:

```md
They both use brackets to house them and you can use the same keyword to add them to the end of an array.
```

Differences:

```md
Ruby will return the new array automatically.
```

## Array#pop vs. Array.prototype.pop()

What are the similarities and differences between Ruby's and JavaScript's `pop`
Array methods?

Similarities:

```md
They both use brackets to house them and you can use the same keyword to remove the last item of an array.
```

Differences:

```md
Ruby will display the deleted item automatically.
```

## Array#shift vs. Array.prototype.shift()

What are the similarities and differences between Ruby's and JavaScript's
`shift` Array methods?

Similarities:

```md
Both function the same way in that they remove the first item(s) of an array.
```

## Array#map vs. Array.prototype.map()

Using Ruby's and JavaScript's `map` Array methods, create a new array consisting
of the squares of the existing array.

Ruby:

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# your answer here
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Will need to revisit these JS callback functions.
```

## Array#reduce vs. Array.prototype.reduce()

Using Ruby's and JavaScript's `reduce` Array methods, find the product of the
numbers in the given array.

Ruby:

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# your answer here
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// your answer here
```

## Array#select vs. Array.protoype.filter()

Using Ruby's `select` Array method and JavaScript's `filter` method, create a
new array consisting of the odd numbers of the existing array.

Ruby:

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# your answer here
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
